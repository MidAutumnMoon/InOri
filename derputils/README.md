# derputils

A set of utils which deserve questioning
what's purpose of their existence in the first place.


## Roadmap?

- [ ] `whereonearth` can unwrap wrappers (niche)
- [x] `fcombine` is useful
- [ ] `diff-nixos` can split generations into sections
- [ ] `diff-nixos` has colors and shaings
- [ ] `diff-nixos` can utilize nix-tree
